My proposal for **Improved Override Management** was selected as an project under **Google Summer of Code 2018**.  I worked with the organisation [Joomla](https://github.com/joomla/). My mentors are **Astrid** ([@astridx](https://github.com/astridx)) **Allon Moritz** ([@laoneo](https://github.com/laoneo)) **zero-24** ([@zero-24](https://github.com/zero-24)).

## Goal

This project adds the feature to Joomla which check for upgrades, if the template file is changed where an override exists, it notifies the user that one of core file of his template overrides is changed with the update, to avoid security issues or functionality issue and he can adjust his override before anyone can notice.

## Conclusion

Joining Joomla and its community is a turning point in my life. Because it made me get familiar with the open source projects, how things deals and prepare for long term support and well as backward compatibility. I learned lot of things which I would have never learned without this project.

The success of this project is my mentors and the Joomla community, everyone helped me a lot in his field when I needed help. So, a special thanks to all for love and support :)
